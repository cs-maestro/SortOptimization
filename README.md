# mySortingAlgorithm

As a college freshman, I was studying Insertion and Selection sort in Intro to Programming class. I realized that we could do it with a more human-like approach and decided to code this algorithm. It has been tested both for validity and speed in the main() method. As a novice, I would be pleased to get feedback from gurus to improve the speed and structure of code.
