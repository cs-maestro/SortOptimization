# mySortingAlgorithm

As a college freshman, I was studying Insertion and Selection sort in Intro to Programming class. I realized that we could do it with a more human-like approach and decided to code and test this algorithm in SortingTest.java file. It has been tested both for validity and speed in the main() method. As a novice, I would be pleased to get feedback from gurus to improve the speed and structure of code. I have also added another file named ArrayListSorting which allows users to add values to a sorted (or empty) ArrayList without randomizing the data set.
